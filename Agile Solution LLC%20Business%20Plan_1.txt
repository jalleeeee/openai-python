Risk identification: We begin by identifying all potential risks that could 
impact the project. This includes internal risks (e.g., delays due to equipment 
failure) and external risks (e.g., weather events).
 
Risk assessment: Once we have identified the risks, we assess their likelihood 
and potential impact on the project. This help s us prioritize the risks and focus 
our efforts on the most significant ones.
 
Risk mitigation: We develop and imp lement mitigation strategies after 
identifying and assessing the risks. This may include implementing safety 

protocols, securing insurance, or developing contingency plans.
 
Risk monitoring and review: Throughout the project, we continuously 
monitor and review the risks to e
nsure they are effectively managed. If 
necessary, we adjust our risk mitigation strategies to ensure the project stays 
on track.
 
By following this p rocess, we can proactively manage risks and minimize their 

impact on the project, which helps to ensure the success of our construction 

projects.
